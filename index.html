    <h1>A sewer pipe crack simulator and data set</h1>
    <p>This webpage contains the dataset and simulator mentioned in the paper 'PIPE-SIM: An In-Pipe Simulator and Dataset for Crack Assessments' </p>
    The dataset mentioned and benchmarked by a YOLOv8 model in the paper is available at https://studentutsedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xing_wang_student_uts_edu_au/EaTnSub7cb5EjUkvv_ludQIBtSzMWhrbH4Bx1OcQV6SOnA?e=MzBzJb
    The following shows the structure of the dataset repository
    <pre>
    Data/
      Train/Data/:  Files related to the training set
        train_images/: Images for the training set. The images are named in chronological order as 0.png, 1.png ....
        labels/: Bounding_box labels, for each image that contains cracks a .txt with the same name as the image was created. Each bounding box was created in the YOLO format as described in the Ultralitics website.
        labels_filtered/: The 'labels/' directory contains very small bounding_boxes located in the dark area of the pipe. They could cause problem, and these labels are filtered out in this folder.
