    <h1>A sewer pipe crack simulator and data set</h1>
    <p>This webpage contains the dataset and simulator mentioned in the paper 'PIPE-SIM: An In-Pipe Simulator and Dataset for Crack Assessments' </p>
    The dataset mentioned and benchmarked by a YOLOv8 model in the paper is available at https://studentutsedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/xing_wang_student_uts_edu_au/EaTnSub7cb5EjUkvv_ludQIBtSzMWhrbH4Bx1OcQV6SOnA?e=MzBzJb
    The following shows the structure of the dataset repository
    <pre>
    Data/
      Train_Data/:  Files related to the training set
        train_images/: Images for the training set. The images are named in chronological order as 0.png, 1.png ....
        labels/: Bounding_box labels, for each image that contains cracks a .txt with the same name as the image was created. Each bounding box was created in the YOLO format as described in the Ultralitics website.
        labels_filtered/: The 'labels/' directory contains very small bounding_boxes located in the dark area of the pipe. They could cause problems, and these labels are filtered out in this folder.
        train_label_1_image/, train_label_2_image/,train_label_3_image/: If there are cracks in a pipe section, there could be 1-3 cracks. These three folders contain blue crack masks on black backgrounds indicating the location of cracks for each image in the train_images/ folder
        image_filtered/: Contains annotated training images. 
        annotation_cracks.py: It creates the files in 'label_filtered/' folder using the mask in the train_label_1_image/, train_label_2_image/,train_label_3_image/ folder
      Valid_Data/: Files related to the validation set
        It has a similar structure to the Train_data folder, however: 
        1. The images and labels are named using the time stamp when the simulated camera takes them 
        2. Camera_position.txt contains the location of the camera at each time point. 
        3. acc_data.txt contains the linear acceleration of the camera at each time point when an image is taken by a camera.
      Test_Data/: Files related to the test set. It has the same structure as the validation set.
